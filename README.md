A program using the genshindev API (https://github.com/genshindev/api) to simulate wishing for Genshin Impact characters (i.e a random character is selected each time the wish function is called), though the rates are inaccurate as every character has an equal chance of being selected. Through the gallery, all characters can be selected directly. With more time, I would have added a function for 10x wishes, added the rarity 3 weapons that act as filler for the wish pool, and adjusted the probabilities to more closely reflect the original game's wish mechanic.
